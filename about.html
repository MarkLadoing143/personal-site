						Welcome, my name is Mark Ladoing. I am a graduate of the Bachelor's in Computer Information Systems (BCIS) at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta, Canada 
						with the goal of entering either a Web or Software Developer position after graduation. I am a strong worker, often putting my mind and heart into everything that is put in front of me,
						and never giving up until I fulfilled what I've promised to complete.<br><br>
						
						It is this resilient attitude which allowed me to thrive through university, bringing me from a young novice with no programming experience to having created the site you see in front of you. 
						I believe that nothing is impossible so long as you fight what you desire, keep your spirits strong, and strive to keep trying to learning even if it means a few failures along the way.<br><br>

						Through the BCIS, I was exposed to a wide variety of IT fields, such as Software Development, Systems Analysis, Computer Architecture, Network Infrastructure, and many others.
						The BCIS also provided students the opportunity to obtain a Minor in Business, allowing me to additionally gain exposure to various Business-related fields like Human Resources, Management, and even Accounting.
						Of all of the things I've done, I most enjoy the creative and technical aspects of programming, and hope to work in Web, Software, or Games Development later down the road.<br><br>
						
						Outside of work, I am a creative person who likes to spend his free time either drawing or writing original works; elements of which I've actually used in some of my previous development projects.
						I am also into graphic design, having self-taught myself to use programs like Adobe Photoshop CS6 Extended, Paint Tool SAI, and GIMP to create various digital works, some of which you can be found on this site.<br><br>
						
						<b>Thank you for visiting and I hope you enjoy your time here!</b>
